<h1>Browser Default CSS</h1>
<p>The first default value the browser sets is actually for the body element's margin. The value most browsers set for the <code>body</code>'s <code>margin</code> is 8 pixels on all sides, so all content is pushed away from the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the viewport (browser window).</p>
	<p>This is the second paragraph. The browser's default <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> should create a space between this paragraph and the next paragraph.</p>
	<p>This is the third paragraph. The space between the second paragraph and this paragraph is based upon the browser's default <code>margin-top</code> and <code>margin-bottom</code> values (about 1em) for paragraphs.</p>
	<p>The following blockquote also shows that the browser's default CSS sets the same values for the <code>margin</code> on the top and bottom, like the paragraphs, but also on the left and right sides (about 40 pixels).</p>

	<p>The Unordered List example shows the browser's default CSS sets <code>margin</code> on the top and bottom (like the paragaph), but the indentation is established by giving a value to the <code>padding-left</code> (about 40 pixels). The sub-list item (within a child unordered list element) also has 40 pixels of padding on the left that pushed it a total of 80 pixels away from the left edge of the parent element (the <code>body</code> element)</p>
